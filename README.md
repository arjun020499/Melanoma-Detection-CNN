# Melanoma-Detection-CNN
This project aims to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system for early detection of melanoma, a type of skin cancer, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system will analyze skin images and classify them into nine different types of skin cancer with an accuracy of 91 %. The project will involve collecting a diverse dataset of annotated skin images, preprocessing and augmenting the data to improve quality and increase diversity. A CNN architecture will be designed and trained using the dataset, employing techniques like regularization and batch normalization to optimize performance.Through extensive testing, validation, and collaboration with dermatologists, the project aims to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the melanoma detection system. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to early intervention and improved patient outcomes by aiding in the early detection of melanoma.
